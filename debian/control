# The .deb here is meant for perl 5.10 with the File::Locate::Iterator
# XS code.  If you build on an older perl then you'll get the
# pure-perl code and in that case add libfile-fnmatch-perl to the
# Depends for File::FnMatch required by that code.

Description: Read a "locate" database file with an iterator
 File::Locate::Iterator reads a "locate" database file, similar to
 File::Locate, but done as an iterator rather than callbacks.
 .
 The iteration is done stand-alone, or there's tie-in subclasses of
 Iterator.pm, Iterator::Simple and MooseX::Iterator too.
